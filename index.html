Alternatively, inertial sensors do not require external infrastructure and are already provided to the public in smartphones. In this talk, 3 indoor studies are shown, where inertial sensors and prior knowledge of the environment and motion are used to track the position and orientation. All methods are based on probabilistic modelling of the knowledge and sensor.</td>

            <td>In the present work, we tackle the problem of detecting serial correlation in the context of directional data. Motivated by a real data example involving sunspots locations, we define a concept of runs properly adapted to the directional context. We then show that tests based on the latter runs enjoy some local and asymptotic property against local alternatives with serial dependence. We compute the finite sample performances of our tests using Monte Carlo simulations and show their usefulness on a real data illustration that involves the analysis of sunspots locations for various solar cycles.</td>

            <td>In Stein's method, one can characterise probability distributions with differential operators. These characterisations are used to obtain new point estimators for the parameters of spherical distributions. As a consequence of the usually simple form of the operator, explicit estimators are obtained in cases where standard methods, such as maximum likelihood estimation, require a numerical procedure to calculate the estimate. Among others, competitive estimators for the concentration parameter of the von Mises-Fisher distribution and an explicit estimator for all parameters of the Fisher-Bingham distribution are obtained. We also consider a real-data example from machine learning.</td>

            <td>In many practical parameter estimation problems, the observation model is periodic with respect to the unknown parameters. In these directional cases, the appropriate estimation criterion is periodic in the parameter space, and cyclic performance bounds should be used. However, existing cyclic performance bounds do not account for the common scenario of model misspecification. The misspecified Cramér-Rao bound (MCRB) provides a lower bound on the mean-squared-error (MSE) for estimation problems under model misspecification. However, the MCRB does not provide a valid bound for periodic problems. In this work, we close this gap by developing the cyclic MCRB, which is a lower bound on the mean cyclic error (MCE) of any Lehmann unbiased estimator under model misspecification in periodic estimation problems. Thus, it can be seen as a generalization of the cyclic CRB for cases where the assumed model (observations distribution) may be different from the true one. The proposed cyclic MCRB and the performance of the misspecified maximum likelihood (MML) estimator are compared in terms of MCE in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation under the misspecified assumption of white additive noise, where the true covariance is colored.</td>

            <td>In circular data analysis, anomalous observations (or outliers) may influence the main findings and conclusions. Thus, the need for outlier detection methods for circular data arises. Unlike other proposals available in the literature, assuming the bulk of the data comes from a von Mises distribution, a new technique based on the robust estimates of its parameters is introduced. Furthermore, a circular outlier map, a graphical tool for outlier detection, is also constructed. The introduced approach is illustrated and compared with existing methodologies through a series of real data examples.</td>

            <td>Skeletal representations (s-reps) have been successfully adopted to parsimoniously parametrize the shape of three-dimensional objects and have been particularly employed in analyzing hippocampus shape variation. Within this context, we provide a fully nonparametric dimension-reduction tool based on kernel smoothing for determining the main source of variability of hippocampus shapes parametrized by s-reps. The methodology introduces the so-called density ridges for data on the polysphere and involves addressing high-dimensional computational challenges. For the analyzed dataset, our model-free indexing of shape variability reveals that the spokes defining the sharpness of the elongated extremes of hippocampi concentrate the most variation among subjects.</td>
